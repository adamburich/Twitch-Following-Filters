# Following Filters for Twitch

This extension injects a UI element into https://www.twitch.tv/directory/following/live


This UI element allows us to filter our followed channels in two ways:
 - Show channels playing only selected games
 - Hide channels playing selected games


Use the checkmark or hit enter in the text area to apply a filter, and use the trashcan to clear your filters.


Note that this extension automatically redirects the "Overview" section of the following page (https://www.twitch.tv/directory/following) to the "Live" section (https://www.twitch.tv/directory/following/live).
